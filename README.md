# ExportNCR

Excel VBA code for a QA non conformance register.

To automate the following:
- copy/paste NCR number which is used as a lookup for formulas on the NCR form
- remove formulas (copy/paste values)
- copy NCR form sheet to a new workbook and save (filename based on NCR ID)

The new workbook can then be edited, further details added, photos etc.
Also, if the file already exists, it will be opened rather than creating a new one.
